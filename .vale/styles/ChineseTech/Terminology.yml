# ChineseTech/Terminology.yml - Chinese Technical Documentation Terminology Standardization
# 
# Purpose: 
# - Enforce consistent technical terminology usage in Chinese documentation
# - Suggest standardized technical terms to replace informal or inconsistent language
# - Improve documentation professionalism and consistency
#
# Rule Type: substitution (replacement rules)
# - When "key" (non-standard term) is detected, suggest replacement with "value" (standard term)
# - ignorecase: false - case-sensitive matching
# - level: warning - suggests changes but doesn't block builds

  # Equipment terminology standardization
  # Purpose: Standardize on "设备" (equipment/device) for industrial apparatus
  # Context: Technical manuals, operation guides, specifications
  机械: 设备          # "mechanical" → "equipment" 
  装置: 设备          # "apparatus" → "equipment"
  仪器: 设备          # "instrument" → "equipment"
  器械: 设备          # "machinery" → "equipment"
  
  # Temperature terminology precision
  # Purpose: Use precise technical term "温度" instead of colloquial expressions
  # Context: Technical parameters, measurements, process requirements
  热度: 温度          # "heat level" → "temperature"
  冷热: 温度          # "hot/cold" → "temperature"
  
  # Pressure system terminology standardization
  # Purpose: Distinguish between atmospheric pressure and system pressure
  # Context: Hydraulic systems, pneumatic systems documentation
  气压: 压力          # "air pressure" → "pressure"
  
  # Safety operation terminology optimization
  # Purpose: Use more precise operational guidance terms
  # Context: Safety procedures, operational warnings
  谨慎: 小心          # "cautious" → "careful"
